description: Garrett P. Serviss (1851-1929) was an astronomer, popularizer of astronomy,
  and early science fiction writer. In his private life Serviss was an enthusiastic
  mountain climber, describing his reaching the summit of the Matterhorn at the age
  of 43 as part of an effort "to get as far away from terrestrial gravity as possible."
  Five of Serviss's books are science fiction (a term not invented when he wrote),
  of which The Second Deluge is one. It tells the story of a devastating flood across
  the entire earth, and of Cosmo Versal, a modern day Noah, who faces of public ridicule
  and disbelie.
